Future Enhancements

Unfortunately, due to personal grievances, which led me to loose my first project which was a memory game i had to restart project 2 as a quiz due to time and I was unable to implement other ideas I wanted to include in this quiz. My time was cut very short; however, if I had more time, I would have been able to add them.
  
- Add a timer to each question to make the game more challenging.
- Implement a database to store high scores and allow users to compete with others.
- Expand the question bank to offer a more extensive quiz experience.
- Creating a contents page where it links to different quiz challenges depending on the topic/subject.

## HTML and CSS Validation:

I often validated my HTML and CSS code whilst building the website to avoid making the same small errors and to decrease work load at end of project. 

Upon running my HTML code i had 0 problems due to the fact i was continuosly keeping an eye on it, however i did encounter a error when i went to validate my CSS code as you can see below.

As you can see it was a very simple mistake , a word which was mistyped. After fixing this error the site has 0 errors.
