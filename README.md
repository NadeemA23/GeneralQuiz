Future Enhancements

Unfortunately, due to personal grievances, which led me to loose my first project which was a memory game i had to restart project 2 as a quiz due to time and I was unable to implement other ideas I wanted to include in this quiz. My time was cut very short; however, if I had more time, I would have been able to add them.
  
- Add a timer to each question to make the game more challenging.
- Implement a database to store high scores and allow users to compete with others.
- Expand the question bank to offer a more extensive quiz experience.
- Creating a contents page where it links to different quiz challenges depending on the topic/subject.
